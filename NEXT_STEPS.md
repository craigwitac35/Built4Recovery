# Built4Recovery – Recommended First Tweaks

Great foundation. The best first move is to refine **tone** before changing structure.

## 1) Tone (do this first)
- Lock one clear voice profile: direct, grounded, compassionate, zero fluff.
- Define your "line" between encouragement and challenge so every section sounds consistent.
- Keep language plain and practical; avoid abstract motivational phrasing.

## 2) Core Story Layer (second)
- Add a concise origin story block (what happened, what changed, what this platform is for).
- Tie your story to credibility and method, not just inspiration.

## 3) Section Tightening (third)
- Reorder sections so visitors move from pain -> hope -> framework -> action.
- Ensure each section ends with one clear next action.

## 4) Tactical + Faith Balance (fourth)
- If you want stronger faith emphasis, make it explicit but practical:
  - identity
  - discipline
  - daily action
- Keep tactical steps adjacent to belief statements.

## 5) Conversion Readiness (fifth)
- Add one primary CTA path (email signup or program waitlist).
- Draft one lead magnet aligned with your core framework.

## Suggested immediate next pass
1. Rewrite homepage hero and intro in final tone.
2. Add your 5-7 sentence deeper story.
3. Create one "Start Here" CTA section.

If you want, the next edit can be a **before/after rewrite of your homepage hero + intro** in 3 tone options:
- Strong + tactical
- Balanced + pastoral
- Darker + confrontational
